		<h3>As my ancestor made home in an another country by sharing their langauge, culture and religion, it caused an issue of Bhutan's Nationality Law of 1958. Bhutan government establishes strict rules for all the citizens to follow, which were:</h3>
			<ul>
					<li>Speaking other language was forbided</li> <br/>
					<li>Only Bhutanese uniforn, other uniform was forbided to wear in public</li> <br/>
					<li>Follow Bhutanese's beliefs and religion</li> <!--This Rules are what my parents told me, and not through any research, because they were the one physically experienced it-->
					
			</ul>
			<p>In 1990, it caused a large protest for Nepalese rights. My parents were involved in the right, because they wanted the privilege to follow their religion and value freely.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section2">
				<h3>Sadly,the protest caused chaos and erupted fires in people homes</h3>
				<p>Bhutanese authories started destroying Nepalis' property, arresting protester, torturing and killing Nepali's aggressivly. In this act, many of my cousins were killed by the police in the protest. In December 1990, the authories announced that if Nepali's do not prove their citizenship, and they will have to leave the country. But, their intentions were killing them right there and then, if we did not prove the citizenships</p>
			</div>
			<div class="section3">
			<h3>Leaving the Country</h3>
			<p>My parents had their citizenship but knew that they still will be killed, therefore decided to quietly leave the country overnight with their whole family. Sadly, that night my dad's family did not came, so he had no choice but leave without his sisters, brothers, or parents. My parents were leaving their homeland, not knowing that they will never return</p>
